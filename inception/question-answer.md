● What is Emmet?

Emmet is a tool that helps a web developer to write code faster with fewer instructions. Emmet syntax provides an easy way to produce HTML code with CSS selectors.
It creates HTML code snippets with simple shortcut commands.

We can integrate Emmet to the IDE and save the typing effort and avoid typos while creating HTML.

ex: html:5
div.item\*5

● Difference between a Library and Framework?

Developers can invoke libraries to perform specific tasks by using components, classes, and methods. A framework, however, already provides code to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality.

Library:

A Library is unopinionated on how the application code is written.

A Library is a collection of APIs that our apps can easily integrate and call to add additional functionality on the go.

The purpose of libraries is to perform a defined and specific task.

Libraries provide Good code quality, reusability, and control, enhanced speed and performance of the program, etc.

It is easy to replace one library with another.

Framework:

A Framework provide a standard way to build applications.

A framework takes the control and calls the app code. Frameworks describe how developers design applications.

Frameworks can be used for performing a wide range of tasks.

Faster programming, support from the community, great support for MVC (Model View Controller) pattern, etc.

Frameworks are hard to Replace.

● What is CDN? Why do we use it?

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

● Why is React known as React?

React was developed for applications that have constantly changing data. React is a front-end framework or the “View” in MVC, this means that as the user clicks around and changes the app’s data, the view should “react” or change with those user events. User events being mouse clicks, typing, submitting a form.

● What is crossorigin in script tag?

The crossorigin attribute is a CORS settings attribute. It controls, for scripts that are obtained from other origins, whether error information will be exposed.

If we do not provide 'crossorigin' attributes, the browser(window.onerror) will not get the error information generated by the scripts from other origins.

● What is the difference between React and ReactDOM

React and ReactDOM are ReactJs libraries. React is used to create elements and interact with react elements. This code is not specific to browsers.

ReactDOM is used for DOM manipulation. It has the render method that mounts the react elements to the DOM. When the ReactDOM.render() is first called it replaces any HTML elements already present on the DOM with the returned HTML. During subsequent calls it finds the difference between the exisiting DOM Nodes and the newly returned DOM Nodes and updates DOM with the differnce.
ReactDOM has other useful methods that can be used to manipulate DOM as well.

● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

react.development.js is the full version of the react code and can be used while using React App development.

react.production.js is the minified code that is optimized for production and should be used in the Apps that are in production.

● What is async and defer?

Both async and defer in Script tags are used to optimize the loading time of websites. Without these attributes, the browser pauses HTML parsing when it encounters the script tag and sends Network request for the script files. When the script files are received, it executes the script files and only then it would continue with HTML parsing.

async - When the Script has async attribute, the browser sends the network request for the script files without pausing HTML parsing. When the script files
are received, the browser will pause the HTML parsing, execute the scripts and then continue the HTML parsing. This helps speed up the loading process.

Async is suitable when the application requires scripts that need not be executed in a specific order(for example, some third party scripts). However, async does not guarantee the order in which script files are executed. If the application has many script files and one script file depends on the execution of the other scripts, then using async may result in errors.

defer - When the Script has defer attribute, the browser sends the network request for the script files without pausing HTML parsing. Only arter the HTML is completely parsed, the browser executes the scripts. Unlike async, the browser can execute the scripts in which they are required by the app. Defer is suitable if the application has script files that needs to be executed in a specific order.
